# NIKE_vs_ADIDAS
# Image-Classification-between-Nike-and-Adidas-Shoes-using-PIL-and-tflearn

This python script deals woth creating and working with an image classifier between Nike and Adidas Shoes. It has been
implememted using PIL i.e. Python imaging library instead of openCV and also using the Tensorflow deep learning library, i.e. tflearn. (TF 1.x)

The Dataset just comprises of about **150 images** of the shoes, hence yielding a low accuracy.

Implementation : ```Google Colab```
